# Algorithms, Part I - Rust implementation

This repo contains a first approach to the Rust programming language. \
It contains an easy implementation for most of the algorithms covered in the Princeton's Algorithm Part 1 Course. \
The purpose of this repo is not to provide the most optimized version of the algorithms but to understand the language and cover the sintax of it.
